      <h1>Advance Rock Paper Scissors Game</h1>
      <p id="instructions">The players hold closed fists up at about ear level and incant, "one, two, three, shoot!" At "shoot," the fists are lowered to about mid-chest level, and the players reveal one of three gestures.
Rock
The hand is kept as a fist.
Paper
The hand is flattened, palm down.
Scissors
The index and middle fingers are extended from the fist.

The essential nature of the game is that each gesture is superior to one other gesture, and inferior to another. Rock crushes scissors (a win for rock), but paper covers rock (a loss for rock). Paper covers rock (a win for paper), but scissors cuts paper (a loss for paper). Scissors cuts paper (a win for scissors), but rock crushes scissors (a loss for scissors). In order to win, you have to outguess your opponent, and play the gesture that will beat the gesture your opponent makes.

There's not a lot of strategy, but the game is strangely addictive, and since it's not just a matter of chance, it's actually useful for deciding between even sides in a dispute.

This game it's exactly that difference is you're playing against a computer. You type your gesture in the imput and Good Luck!</p>
